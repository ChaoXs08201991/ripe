# Introduction
Ripe is a 256-bit security tool. It consists of command-line tool and C++ API for cryptography.

Ripe contains encryption API for two major cryptography methods, RSA and AES (Rijndael). Also contains Base64 encoding/decoding API and some helper functions to make data transferable (called prepareData). Binaries do not depend on third-party tools or libraries but development will require cryptography libraries installed in system in order to compile.
